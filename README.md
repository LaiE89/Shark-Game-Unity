# Shark-Game-Unity
A Simple Shark Game created using Unity in 4 hours. Created by Ethan Lai

This game was a difficult race against time. In the first minutes of the challenge, I was merely brainstorming ways to implement the game. I was mainly focusing on ways
to implement a proper camera, and a clean character controller. I also needed time to model my own models. Once I finished the basics of the game, I decided to implement
extra features. However, due to the lack of time, I could not implement everything I had in mind. One of the biggest issues I encountered was the jittery topdown camera.
When the game runs, the shark model was jittery on rotation. To solve this issue, I decided to move the shark model as a child of the camera and place the camera code
to LateUpdate. This solution solved the issue. If I were to implement more features, I would add different types of fishes, more areas to explore, a proper main menu,
settings, and enemies that attack the player. Since the demographic was a younger audience, I decided to use bright and high contrasting colors with simple instructions.
Therefore, children can easily learn the game without any difficulty. I also made sure to implement no violence in any parts.
